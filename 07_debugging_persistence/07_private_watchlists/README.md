# 077. Persistent Private Watchlists

Phase: Production-style debugging, persistence, and data repair. Local order: 07. Follow the [master plan](../../README.md).

## Core

Repair a SQLite-backed private watchlist with ownership checks and durable membership.

Before coding, write your API, invariants, error contract, ownership model, and complexity target. For concurrency, identify shared state, synchronization, cancellation, and shutdown behavior.

## Ordered variants / checks

- [ ] Supplied prompt, 60 min
- [ ] Foreign keys
- [ ] Unique membership
- [ ] Safe deletion
- [ ] Rollback
- [ ] Reopen database
- [ ] Concurrent writes
- [ ] Parameterized SQL
- [ ] Cross-user access tests

## Language passes

- [ ] [Python](python/) core and variants, with tests.
- [ ] [Go](go/) core and variants, with tests.
- [ ] [TypeScript](typescript/) core and variants, with tests.

## Acceptance and review

- [ ] Core happy path, empty/minimal input, invalid input, and exact boundaries pass.
- [ ] Relevant failure paths preserve invariants and do not leave partial mutations.
- [ ] If concurrent: deterministic contention test, bounded work/memory, cancellation, and shutdown pass. Otherwise mark this item N/A in your notes.
- [ ] Responses do not unintentionally expose mutable internal state or another user's data.
- [ ] Explain time/space costs, design choices, and remaining limits without reading code.
- [ ] Repeat the core from scratch under a time limit; record duration and missed edge cases.
