# 034. Hash map and trie

Phase: Data structures and reusable backend components. Local order: 05. Follow the [master plan](../../README.md).

## Core

Implement key lookup and prefix search with explicit key semantics.

Before coding, write your API, invariants, error contract, ownership model, and complexity target. For concurrency, identify shared state, synchronization, cancellation, and shutdown behavior.

## Ordered variants / checks

- [ ] LC 705/706/208/211
- [ ] Collisions
- [ ] Deletion
- [ ] Unicode normalization
- [ ] Wildcard search
- [ ] Autocomplete ranking

## Language passes

- [ ] [Python](python/) core and variants, with tests.
- [ ] [Go](go/) core and variants, with tests.
- [ ] [TypeScript](typescript/) core and variants, with tests.

## Acceptance and review

- [ ] Core happy path, empty/minimal input, invalid input, and exact boundaries pass.
- [ ] Relevant failure paths preserve invariants and do not leave partial mutations.
- [ ] If concurrent: deterministic contention test, bounded work/memory, cancellation, and shutdown pass. Otherwise mark this item N/A in your notes.
- [ ] Responses do not unintentionally expose mutable internal state or another user's data.
- [ ] Explain time/space costs, design choices, and remaining limits without reading code.
- [ ] Repeat the core from scratch under a time limit; record duration and missed edge cases.
