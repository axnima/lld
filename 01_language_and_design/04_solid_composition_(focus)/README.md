# 004. SOLID and composition

Phase: Language, modeling, and test foundations. Local order: 04. Follow the [master plan](../../README.md).

**[Focus — breadth]** Use the session guide to select the core and a few relevant variants. You do not need every checkbox before moving on.

[Session order and progress](../../STUDY_PLAN.md)

## Core

Refactor a notification service whose delivery, formatting, and storage are coupled.

Before coding, write your API, invariants, error contract, ownership model, and complexity target. For concurrency, identify shared state, synchronization, cancellation, and shutdown behavior.

## Ordered variants / checks

- [ ] Composition over inheritance
- [ ] Interface segregation
- [ ] Substitutable implementations
- [ ] Dependency inversion
- [ ] Avoid abstractions with only one purpose

## Language passes

Follow the assigned session scope in one language. Full variants and other languages are later depth passes. Keep a few meaningful correctness checks.

- [ ] [Python](python) core with focused checks; optional variants later.
- [ ] [Go](go) core with focused checks; optional variants later.
- [ ] [TypeScript](typescript) core with focused checks; optional variants later.

## Acceptance and review

- [ ] Core happy path, empty/minimal input, invalid input, and exact boundaries pass.
- [ ] Relevant failure paths preserve invariants and do not leave partial mutations.
- [ ] If concurrent: deterministic contention test, bounded work/memory, cancellation, and shutdown pass. Otherwise mark this item N/A in your notes.
- [ ] Responses do not unintentionally expose mutable internal state or another user's data.
- [ ] Explain time/space costs, design choices, and remaining limits without reading code.
- [ ] Repeat the core from scratch under a time limit; record duration and missed edge cases.
